                prime numbers,he would take the larger number from his
                opponent.Otherwise, the smaller one will be added to his points.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if none of them is prime number demon would lose points
                equal to the sum of them.
            </p>
            <p>If both numbers are the same,The Demon LOSES the game.</p>
